From the data-set, I extract Olist best customers through forecasting their future purchases\n","2.

Who is Fader and Hardie???\n","Few well-established models proposed are as:\n","* `Pareto/NBD Model` by [Schmittlein et al.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24571167) in 1984\n","* `BG/NBD Model` was later proposed by [Fader and Hardie](http://www.brucehardie.com/papers/bgnbd_2004-04-20.pdf) in 2004 => An alternate and easier to implement model then Pareto/NBD Model\n","* [BG/BB Model](https://web-docs.stern.nyu.edu/old_web/emplibrary/Peter%20Fader.pdf) in 2009 => more recent model\n","I will be introducing and actively using `BG/NBD model` within our analysis, both `Pareto/NBD` and `BG/NBD` are supported within `lifetimes`<br>\n","## A quick goto of `BG/NBD Model`: \n","* Customers will come and buy at an interval that's randomly distributed within a reasonable time range\n","* After each purchase they have a certain probability of dying or becoming inactive (never returning to buy again)\n","* Each customer is different and have varying purchase intervals and probability of going inactive\n","\n","## `Model Mathematical Specification`:\n","* Customers buy `stochastically` according to a Poisson distribution with purchasing rate `(λ)-lambda`\n","* After each purchase customer has `p%` chance of becoming inactive \n","  * so time period at which a customer becomes inactive is distributed as a shifted geometric distribution\n","* customer-base is `heterogeneous` across those two parameters such that we can assume a `(γ)-gamma` and `(β)-beta distribution` respectively\n","* at last we assume that `λ` and `p%` across customers are jointly independent\n","  * This makes some of math later on much easier\n","<h1>`λ ~ γ(a,r),p ~ β(a,b)`</h1>\n","\n","## `Family of Models`:\n","* This class of models try to quantify customer behavior under a `non-contractual setting` where we don't know when customers become inactive but rather assign a percentage confidence that we believe they are dead\n","  * In contrast, another class of models are designed for `contractual settings` and have been successfully applied to other businesses such as telecommunication industry where a customer has to tell you that they're ending their relationship\n","    * Example: Large number of subscriber-based firms like Netflix often report and describe their churn rate or customer turnover. CLV is much simpler to quantify on that scale but for a normal product-selling firm, this is much more difficult as were not sure when a customer has decided to terminate relationship\n","* Having a model that can describe customer `deaths` and `purchases over time` is much more effective at inferring their future purchases and subsequent aggregation into expected total sales than a naive \"oh I expect goods sale to grow at maybe 1% next year\".
